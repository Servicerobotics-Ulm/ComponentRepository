	A generic driver for a RangeFinder (depth camera) in the Webots simulator.
	
	The scans are made each Webots timeStep, at the same time (see Time of flight (ToF)). measured in ...
	
	How a new RangeFinder can be added to Webots:
	* Add a new Robot, set its controller to '&lt;extern&gt;', its coordinate system should be x=front, y=left, z=up of the RangeFinder.
	* The robots name must set the same in Webots and here.
	* Add the RangeFinder in children of the robot, rotate it to match the coordinate system above.
	
	example code:
	
	```cpp
	CommBasicObjects::CommMobileLaserScan scan;
	if(this->laserServiceInGetUpdate(scan) != Smart::SMART_OK) (some error handling here)
	int count = scan.get_scan_size();
	for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
		// scan.get_scan_angle is between 0 and 2*pi, 0=front of lidar
		double angle = scan.get_scan_angle(i) / M_PI * 180;
		// angle should be between -180 and +180 degrees, 0=front of lidar
		if( angle > 180 )
			angle -= 360;
		double distance = scan.get_scan_distance(i);
	    ...
	}
