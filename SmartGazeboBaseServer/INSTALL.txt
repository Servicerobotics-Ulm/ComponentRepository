Gazebo 8 installation on Ubuntu 16.04
=========================================================

Stampfer, July 2018

This component is tested with gazebo version 8.0. Get version 8-family as follows:

$ wget https://bitbucket.org/osrf/release-tools/raw/default/one-line-installations/gazebo.sh
$ sh gazebo.sh

This will install gazebo9. This component has not been tested with gazebo9, so 
remove it and install gazebo 8. The above shell script will add the necessary repositories.

$ sudo apt-get remove libgazebo9:amd64 libgazebo9-dev:amd64 gazebo9-plugin-base  gazebo9-common gazebo9
$ sudo apt-get install gazebo8 gazebo8-common gazebo8-plugin-base libgazebo8:amd64 libgazebo8-dev:amd64



You also need the DataRepository checked out into $SMART_ROOT_ACE/repos/DataRepository/. 
Do this according to the official installation instructions. To test the installation / run gazebo:

$ cd $SMART_ROOT_ACE/repos/DataRepository/gazebo
$ bash startGazebo.sh <world_file>

e.g. (tiago wihtout arm, for navigation only):

$ bash startGazebo.sh worlds/tiagoOffice_nav.world

1. This component is tested with gazebo version 8.0.
   To install gazebo, download the installation bash script for ubuntu 16.04: gazebo8_install.sh from: http://gazebosim.org/download
   Then execute: sh ~/Downloads/gazebo8_install.sh to perform the installation.


[OPTIONAL if not started via script $SMART_ROOT_ACE/data/gazebo/startGazebo.sh]:

  2. Make sure that GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH points to ~/.gazebo/ (is used as a prefix 
     for the uri tags in the robot description (tiago/model.sdf) referring to the 
     different files needed.
   
     You can use the following commands (if GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH is 
     initially not set):

       export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-8/  (Can be different 
       depending on your installation)
	   
	   export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:~/.gazebo/

  3. Ensure that all model files of the example office environment are located in
     ~/.gazebo/models/

[/OPTIONAL]

4. Ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH points to $SMART_ROOT_ACE/lib:
       
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SMART_ROOT_ACE/lib

5. Start the simulation with:
	cd $SMART_ROOT_ACE/data/gazebo
        bash startGazebo.sh <world_file>

        e.g. (tiago wihtout arm, for navigation only) bash startGazebo.sh worlds/tiagoOffice_nav.world
   

6. Start the SmartGazeboBaseServer or a SmartSoft deployment containing 
   SmartGazeboBaseServer, respectively.
