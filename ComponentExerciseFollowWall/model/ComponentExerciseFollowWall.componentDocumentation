		Description : "The SmartLaserObstacleAvoid component implements a simple reactive obstacle avoidance. 
It periodically receives laser range scans, calculates steering commands and forwards these to the robot 
base (e.g. SmartPioneerBaseServer or SmartPlayerStageSimulator) for execution. It always navigates in a 
free direction and adopts speed and turnrate. This component is a simple example how to send velocity 
commands to the base and how to work with laser scans.

It further illustrates the use of component parameters. The calculated speed is thresholded
according to a variation point (parameter 'v_x') before providing the navigation commands through one of its services.
This parameter 'v_x' can be configured during runtime of the component through its parameter service. See the video tutorials
for more information.

Note: This component is used in Tutorials (e.g. Lesson 1). It is part of the video tutorials and has been shown in:

variability in robotics software development. Tutorial on Managing Software Variability in Robot Control
