ComponentDocumentation ComponentRobotinoBaseServer {

	Description : "The SmartRobotinoBaseServer makes the Robotino platform available. It handles all the communication with the hardware. It offers several services for controlling the robot, such as sending navigation commands to the base and providing access to the robot's odometry. Position updates can be sent to the component to overcome odometry failures."
	License : "LGPL"
	HardwareRequirements : "FESTO Robotino3 robot base"
	Purpose : "Hardware-Driver"
	
	
	ComponentPort  LocalizationUpdateServiceIn {
		Description : "Port for corrections of base pose to overcome the odometry failure. Accepts a pair of an old uncorrected pose and a new corrected pose. The deviation between these two poses is applied to correct the current pose of the robot."
	}
	ComponentPort NavigationVelocityServiceIn {
		Description : "Send new navigation velocity commands v and omega to hardware base. The values are thresholded by the min and max values specified in the ini file before being sent."
	}
	ComponentPort BaseStateServiceOut {
		Description : "Push the base state containing current information about the robot's velocity, pose, raw pose. Should be used when a continuous base pose is required. For example, the SmartLaserLMS200Server uses the latest base pose (received continuously) to stamp the laser scan with the robot's pose at the time the scan was recorded."
	}
	CoordinationSlavePort CoordinationPort {
		ParameterPort : "Accept parameters at runtime. See section Parameters."
	}
	ComponentPort BaseStateQueryServiceAnsw {
		Description : "Query port to request the base state. Analogous to basePositionPushTimedServer, but a query service. Should be used when the base pose is needed sporadically, for example by a behavior component which explicitly needs to query the base pose from time to time."
	}
