INSTALL
=====================================================================

1. The component need the FTDI linux driver (version 1.0.4 tested) to be globally installed to the system once.
   Therefor execute the INSTALL_FTDI.sh script as root (sudo).

2. UDEV RULE
   Segway vendor ID is 0x0403

   Insert the following udev rule to e.g /etc/udev/rules.d/usbftdi.rules
   # For FTDI FT232 & FT245 USB devices with Vendor ID = 0x0403, Product ID = 0xe729
   SYSFS{idProduct}=="e729", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -rq ftdi_sio product=0xe729 vendor=0x0403", MODE="0777"

FOR Ubuntu 16.04:
        #Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0403:e729 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd Segway Robotic Mobility Platforms 200
       # idVendor=0403, idProduct=e729
       SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="e729", MODE="0666", GROUP="users", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -rq ftdi_sio product=0xe729 vendor=0x0403"

3. To be sure that the udev rule is loaded you may want to restart the system.

=====================================================================

The INSTALL_FTDI.sh does:
  - Download and extract FTDI linux driver version 1.0.4 (tested) : http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
  (Installation of FTDI driver reproduced here for convenience)

  - It installs either the 32 or the 64 bit version of the libftd2xx.so.0.4.16 to /usr/local/lib

  - It installs the ftd2xx.h and WinTypes.h headers to /usr/local/include/ftd2xx 
  
  - It creates sysmlink to the so file from /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so /usr/lib/libftd2xx.so 


=====================================================================
Problems with the UDEV rules or the usb device:

      To instantiate a udev rule, run the following command:

      # sudo udevcontrol reload_rules <CR>

      (You only need to run this command once. The rule file will always be executed at system startup.)
      Plug in the FTDI device with the customized VID/PID and enter:

      # dmesg | grep FTDI  <CR>


      This will confirm a successful driver load. You should see the following:

      [   15.768872] drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for FTDI USB Serial Device
      [   15.768927] ftdi_sio 4-1:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
      [   15.769177] usb 4-1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0

      The new VID/PIDs will stay resident on the Linux PC after shutdown and restart.
      
    8. Important: Create links for ftd2xx.h and WinTypes.h from /usr/local/ftdi to /usr/include
    
    
    If you have problems with this check with usbview (search on the internet for application 
	or it can be sent to you by ftdi) or lsusb (command line tool) to check the usb file system is mounted properly.  
	
	Other problems will be related to the ftdi_sio driver loading - 
-->	1.you must unload this driver (and usbserial) if it is attached to your device ("rmmod ftdi_sio" and "rmmod usbserial" as root user). 
	2.Your PID/VID has not been included in the distribution.A PID of 0x6006 and VID of
	0x0403 should work as a temporary workaround.
