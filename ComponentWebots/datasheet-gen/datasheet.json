	"name": "ComponentWebots",
	"shortDescription": "
	
	This component starts the [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com) simulator.
	 
	If another webots simulator is already running, this component will ask to end it first before starting the new one, because two simulations could make the computer very slow.
	 
	Edit the system model *.systemParam file to change which world file is loaded by webots in this system.
	
	Example:
	
	```
	    ComponentParameterInstance ComponentWebots refinesParamStruct ComponentWebots {
	        ParameterRefinement General{
	            WorldPath = "/the/path/to/my/folder/MyWorldName.wbt"
	        }
	    }
	```
	#### Editor
	
	The Editor can add, move, change and delete Locations, Stations or Waypoints.
	
	To turn on the editor:
	* set parameter enableEditor=true
	* add to the world file (*.wbt)
	``` 
	Editor {
	}
	``` 
	
	The Editor will add these new named Groups to the world:
	```
	...
	DEF Locations Group
	DEF Stations Group
	DEF Waypoints Group
	DEF WaypointConnections Group
	...
	```
	
	(In Webots, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> to restore the layout in case some windows are missing)
	 
	A **Location** is a cross on the floor as goal point for free robot movement. The robot will find a path by using its map and avoid obstacles by using its sensors.
	
	To add an Location:
	* double click on the Group 'Locations'
	* click on 'children'
	* right-click 'Add New'
	* find 'Location' or select it from 'PROTO nodes (Current Project)'
	
	Double click on the newly added Location, enter an unique name.
	
	To move an Location:
	* click on the cross, press <kdb>shift</kdb> while moving it with the mouse [(moving a solid object)](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-3d-window#moving-a-solid-object)
	* to rotate it, use the blue curved arrow 
	
	Fields of the Location
	* *name* : the name of the Location
	* *translation* : (x y z) coordinate, z should be 0 (up)
	* *rotation* : (0 0 1 angle) = rotate around (0 0 1) axis (up) by angle radians  
	* *color* : the color of the cross
	* *radius* : robot will move to the Location until its distance is less than this value
	* *smallerRadius* :
	    * 0 (default): stop if distance is less then double the radius
	    * > 0 : after stopping at radius distance, move again to smallerRadius distance
	
	A **Station** can be
	* OPC_UA_Station
	* RollerConveyorStation
	
	Fields:
	* *id* : a unique number
	* *port* : Default port for OPC UA communication is 4840. Each OPC_UA_Station must have an different port number e.g. 4840 4841 ... [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers). port -1 disables communication. Changing the port restarts the OPC UA program.
	
	**Waypoints** can be connected by one way **WaypointConnections**. Mobile robots must use stay on these connections to travel from one Waypoint to another. Robots can use intersections of two connections. Connections are one-way only, e.g. if there is a connection from A to B, there can't be a direct connection from B to A. A selected Waypoint is red if it is too close to other Waypoints. Connections have green arrows of length 1m.
	
	These keys are used in the graphics window of webots (can be found on the right side of an standard PC keyboard) if the simulation is running and the ComponentWebots Editor is enabled:
	* <kbd>Insert</kbd> or <kbd>+</kbd> : create a new Waypoint, connect it to the old selected Waypoint if possible
	* <kbd>Del</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> : delete the selected Waypoint or WaypointConnection
	* <kbd>*</kbd> : while pressing this key and selecting a new Waypoint, a connection from the old selected Waypoint and the new one is made
	* <kbd>/</kbd> : while pressing this key and selecting Waypoint or WaypointConnection, the defaultWaypointWidth of the Editor is applied to it
	* <kbd>space</kbd> : send changes in Waypoints or WaypointsConnections to the navigation system
	
	**Editor** fields:
	* *defaultWaypointWidth* : The diameter of newly added Waypoints or the width of newly added WaypointConnections (in meters). To set this value to an existing Waypoint/WaypointConnection, select it while pressing the <kbd>/</kbd> key.
	* *showWaypoints* : if set to false, all Waypoints and WaypointConnections are invisible
	
	To add/delete Stations or Locations, you can quit the System and start webots directly by typing 'webots' in a console. The same world will be loaded, but the simulation will be stopped. After all changes are done, save the world, quit webots and start the System again. 
	
	#### How to install Webots in Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
	
	if webots was already installed, deinstall the old version first:
	
	```
	sudo dpkg -r webots
	```
	
	go to [https://cyberbotics.com/](https://cyberbotics.com/)
	
	click on 'Download', download [webots_2021b_amd64.deb](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021b/webots_2021b_amd64.deb) into your Downloads-folder, then do:
	
	```
	sudo apt install ~/Downloads/webots_2021b_amd64.deb
	```
	
	Add to your ~/.profile:
	
	```
	export WEBOTS_HOME=/usr/local/webots
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$WEBOTS_HOME/lib/controller
	```
	
	#### Add Webots library and include path to an component project
	
	Add to component's smartsoft/CMakeLists.txt the following lines:
	
	```
	INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES($ENV{WEBOTS_HOME}/include/controller/cpp)
	TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${PROJECT_NAME} $ENV{WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller/libCppController.so)
	```
	
	Then do:
	- right click on Component in Project Explorer
	- properties
	- expand 'C/C++ General'
	- Paths and Symbols
	- includes
	- GNU C++
	- Add...<br>
	  <code>${WEBOTS_HOME}/include/controller/cpp</code>
	- rebuild index (e.g. by closing and opening this project)

	#### Webots in the Virtual machine
	
	It is best to start the virtual machine with VMWare Player in Windows. [[1]](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/general-bugs#virtualization)
	It was tested with VMWare Workstation Player 15 (both non-commercial and PRO version).
	
	You need at least 8 MB Ram and a good graphics card on your computer.
	In the settings of the virtual machine, give it at least 4 GB Ram, 512 MB graphics memory and turn on graphics card acceleration. OpenGl is required by webots to run fast.
	
	If your computer has not a very good graphics card, webots may run slowly in the virtual machine. The simulation speed should be near to '1.00x' at the top of the webots window. If it is below, you can speed things up: 
	* webots window, at the left side is the Scene Tree, first entry is WorldInfo, double click on it, it expands, now click on basicTimeStep, double the value from 32 to 64 or again to 128. This will speed up the simulation but makes it less accurate as changes are done less frequently. [[2]](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree) [[3]](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/glossary)
	* you can reduce here the value FPS too (frames per second, how often graphics is done)
	* turn off/on graphics rendering by pressing the cube button or pressing CTRL+4
	
	##### Shared Folders
	
	If you want to share files among virtual machine and the host computer, enable the shared folders [[5]](https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/ws_running_shared_folders.html). If it does not work, execute this command in the virtual machine (don't add this to an login-script):
	
	
	```
	sudo vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs/ -o allow_other -o uid=1000
	```
	
	##### Gazebo in the virtual machine
	
	If you want to start Gazebo directly from the virtual machine's console, do the following line first:
	
	```
	export SVGA_VGPU10=0
	```
