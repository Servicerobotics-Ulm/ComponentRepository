ComponentWebotsMpsDocking/shortDescription=\n\nComponentWebotsMpsDocking moves (docks) the mobile robot very precisely and closely to an production station.\n\nAfter that the transfer of an stacking container between the mobile robot and the production station is done by [ComponentWebotsConveyorBeltOpcua](../ComponentWebotsConveyorBeltOpcua).\n\nThere is a demo to see this component in action\: start SystemWebotsNavMpsDockingOPCUA, go to the window with 'ComponentTCLSequencer' and enter a number.\n\nFirst, the robot is moved to an area in front of the production station by the system. Only than docking is possible.\n\nCommands are given by setting the ComponentMode\:\n- **laserDocking** or **irDocking** docks the mobile robot to the production station\n- **unDocking**\: the robot moves backwards from the production station to some distance\n\nDocking\:\n- if the distance to the production station is bigger than parameter *maxDistanceToDockingPoint*, send event LASER_DOCKING_ERROR and stop with an error\n- send event LASER_DOCKING_NOT_DONE\n- rotate the robot to match the orientation of the production station\n- move the robot very close in front of the production station\n- send event LASER_DOCKING_DONE\n\nMeaning of the signal lights (on the mobile robot)\:\n- **red**\: an error occured\n- **yellow**\: warning, robot is moving (light is flashing)\n- **green**\: not used\n
