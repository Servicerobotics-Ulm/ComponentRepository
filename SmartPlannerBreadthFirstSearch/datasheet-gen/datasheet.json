	"description": "<p></p><p> The SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch provides path planning services based on grid maps. It uses a grid map from a map building component (e.g. SmartMapperGridMap) and sends an intermediate waypoint as well as the goalpoint to the motion execution (e.g. SmartCdlServer).</p><p> A wave propagation algorithm starting from goal cells backward to the current position of the robot is used to calculate a path. The path planning is further enhanced by a path shortening heuristic: the path is followed starting at the current robot position until a straight line from the robot position to the cell in question on the path interferes with an obstacle. The prior cell is then sent as an intermediate waypoint. The geometric path planning is applied continuously every one second.</p><p> Several goal circles and/or goal lines can be specified as goals in the planner. The planner will generate a path to the goal with the shortest distance.</p><p> The SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch for example can be used with SmartCdlServer which cannot handle local minimas. Goals are then specified in the SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch. A CDL_GOAL_REACHED event is fired by the CDL component as soon as the final goal is reached.</p><p> See also: Christian Schlegel.
